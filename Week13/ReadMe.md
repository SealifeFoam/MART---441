<b> Implement at least five of these.</b>

Make the character jump with the spacebar instead of the up button. [check]

Change the gravity of the stars.[check]

Change the gravity, so each star has gravity.[]

Use different sprites for the player - look in the assets folder.[check] 
-where could I get usable sprite sheets? 

Why not add some spikes you must avoid? You could create a new ‘spikes’ group and check for collision vs. the player, only instead of killing the spike sprite you kill the player instead. []

For a non-violent style game, you could make it a speed-run and challenge them to collect the stars as quickly as possible. []

Create different graphics to gather with different values if you get them.[check]

Add more platforms.[check]

Add a new level if they collect all the stars (or whatever you have on the screen). Show the current level that the player is on.[]
