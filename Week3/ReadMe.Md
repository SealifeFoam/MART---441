1/31/2022 : I was confused at first with what need for this assignment, but looked at the example and had it click to me. First I choose a story I am working on from one of my notebooks and turned it into a short adventure. Then I had to organize. I was just impossible for me to work on this without some sort of system to go on so I ended up choosing an 1-A system. For example if you choose between A and B, it would take you to C, D or 1. 

2/6/2022 : Turning in today - I hope this is at least entertaining at least.
