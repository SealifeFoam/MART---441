I had alot of trouble this week. And worst the issue prabably has the simplest soluation. 

I wanted to create a five image matching game but for some reason the other three images won't show up. I've tried messing with the functions to get what I was intending, however whenever I did it would then refuse to show the top (fish side ) of the cards. 

idk whats going on- anyone have any ideas?
