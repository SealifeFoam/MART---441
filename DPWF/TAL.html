    <h3>The Threat Against Literature</h3>
<p>
    An open letter to the ladies, gentlemen, binary and nonbinary, intersex and beings alike, who support an open and free informational library. </p>  

  <p> I come to you in anger and frustration, to address horrific news and to plead for your help and support against a literary threat. 
    
    In November 2019, <i><u>Gender Queer</u></i> was removed from our local library by means of being challenged. Normally, a challenge means nothing more than an illogical complaint. However, <i><u>Gender Queer</u></i> along with the YA novel <i><u>Lawn Boy</u></i>, were put on trial for LGBTQ content and accused for being “unsuited for any age group”. As of present, <i><u>Lawn Boy</u></i> is off the hook and back on its respective shelf. But <i><u>Gender Queer</u></i> is presently placed in limballic hell of being both banned from Imagine If Library, and unbanned but off shelfed.
    In the fight against the unjust removal for <i><u>Gender Queer</u></i>, it  has come to attention that a canidate for the library board of trustees is none other than the person who challenged <i><u>Gender Queer</u></i> in the first place, Carmen Cuthbertson. </p>
   
    <blockquote>
    “I’m in favor of removing this book from the library not because it is a book about a gender queer person, but becasuse it is a poorly written childishly illustrated jumble of nightmarish recollection that blithely dispense medically questionable advice to vulnerable teen audience,-” </p>
    <p>
      “As a side note, removing a book from a library collection is not book banning. A book is not banned if you are free to buy it on Amazon. ” </i>
    
    <p><cite>- Carmen Cuthbertson in the Flathead Beacon by Mica Drew’s article 
    Library Board Recommends Three Candidates for Open Seat </cite></blockquote>
     
   <p> It would be a <strong>disgrace and horror</strong> to the Imagine If Library if Cuthbertson was voted into the board of trustees. Not only as a threat to literature, LGBTQ matieral, and the graphic literary arts, but to those who value and treasure the library as a place to read, learn and to be challenged by the material one picks up. Cuthbertson does not uphold these values, putting the literary institution in a compromised position for books and people. Further proof of her being unqualified for the position is her inability to understand her actions as banning and censorship, and continues to insist otherwise when the very definition of banning entails the very actions she has committed to. 
    </p>
    <p>I plead with you to not allow a seat to Miss Cuthbertson for the sake of our library. Set an example for libraries in-state and beyond.
